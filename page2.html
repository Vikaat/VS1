		<p1> Hey guys! I am running for your Sophomore Class Secretary.</p1> 
		<br><br>	
		<p1> First things first. Homeroom. Homeroom is not of interest to many 
		people at our school it is time consuming and the lessons they have aren't as engaging as they should be. So, I would like to 
		propose as a secretary that instead of wiping out Homeroom entirely, we should wipe out 75% of it. We should have 15 minutes of 
		Homeroom every 2 weeks and an extra 45 minutes of Bear Time. I believe we should only have homeroom for 15 minutes every 2 weeks 
		as a social-emotional health check in and nothing more than that. This is because a lot of the students I know like Bear time more than 
		Homeromm because of the environmental structures.</p1>
		<br><br>
		<p1> Second, I want to create a weekly Q&A Session for our Class. I want to be able to use this Q&A Session to bring your suggestions, questions, requests, etc... 
			to our future Class Officers. This is your chance to be heard. Make sure you use your right to vote and I hope you vote for me! More to Come Later </p1>
